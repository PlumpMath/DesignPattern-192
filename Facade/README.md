# Facade Pattern

The Facade Pattern provides a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem. Facade defines a higher-level interface that makes the subsystem easier to use.

Note:

It is similar to the Adapter Pattern. The difference between these two is their intent. The intent of the Adapter Pattern is to 'alter' an interface so that it matches the client is expecting. The intent of the Facade Pattern is to provide a 'simplied' interface to a subsystem.

Design Principles:

- Principle of Least Knowledge - talk only to your immediate friends. (Decoupling)
