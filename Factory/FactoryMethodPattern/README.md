#Factory Method Pattern

The Factory Method Pattern defines an interface for creating an object, but lets subclasses decide which class to instantiate. Factory Method lets a class defer instantiation to subclasses.

Design Principles:

1. Identify the aspects of your application that vary and separate them from what stays the same

2. Program to an interface, not an implementation

3. Class should be open for extension, but closed for modification

4. Dependency Inversion Principle - Depend upon abstractions. Do not depend upon concrete classes.
