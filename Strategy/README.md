#Strategy Pattern

The Strategy Pattern defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.

Design Principles:

1. Identify the aspects of your application that vary and separate them from what stays the same

2. Program to an interface, not an implementations

3. Favour composition over inheritance (HAS-A can be better than IS-A)
